# Code Snippets for BIER Hub Sites

## Best Practices

- **Build for mobile.** <br>From the start, make HTML/CSS elements that are mobile friendly (Bootstrap components are helpful with this and are built into Hub).

- **Try to keep all CSS styling in your highest text-box.** <br>This makes it easier to keep track. If you have multiple CSS styling throughout the site, they may conflict and you won't know which CSS style is being applied properly.

- **Use WAVE for accessibility checks.** <br>https://wave.webaim.org/ and use Chrome extension.

- **Design for the user.** <br>Ensure the site is easy to use for both a new user, and a veteran user. This includes having multiple navigation options, one that flows through the site naturally for new users, and quick access to pages/sections for veteran users.

- **Keep elements in separate text widgets.** <br>Hub has several different widgets you can use and drag and drop around, use this to your advantage. Have custom elements in separate text widgets so you can move them around easily as needed.
